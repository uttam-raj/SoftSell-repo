# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


# SoftSell – License Resale Landing Page
Welcome! This is a modern, responsive landing page built using React. It’s designed to help users sell unused software licenses through a smooth and professional interface.


## Features Implemented
Hero Section: Bold animated headline with call-to-action button for user engagement.

How It Works: Simple 3-step explanation using icons for clarity.

Why Choose Us: Trust-building list that highlights security, speed, and support.

Testimonials: Realistic-looking quotes with a clean layout.

Contact Form: Easy-to-fill form with dropdown for license type and message input.

Dark/Light Mode Toggle: One-click switch between light and dark themes.

Typing Animation: The headline uses a typewriter effect to attract attention.

Fully Responsive Design: Looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile screens.


## Design Choices
Dark-first Theme: Prioritized dark mode for a modern, professional look. Light mode is just one click away.

Modular Components: Each section is split into its own component for clarity and reuse.

Custom CSS: Avoided frameworks to maintain full control over design.

Animations: Used keyframe animations for subtle flair—especially in the hero title.

Icons: Used react-icons for easy visual communication without image overhead.

## Time Spent
This project took me around 1 days to complete. Most of the time went into:

Designing a good user flow.

Making the layout clean and responsive.

Testing dark/light mode interactions.

Tweaking animations and text alignment.

Debugging responsiveness for all screen sizes.

## Getting Started
  npm install
  npm start
